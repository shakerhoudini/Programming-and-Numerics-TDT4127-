    "Computers represent numbers, in base 2, as bits. They have a finite amount of bits available, and to keep the number representations equal across programming languages and platforms, standards are made for how a computer is to store numbers internally. To represent decimal numbers, Python uses double precision floating point numbers (doubles). Doubles consist of 8 bytes, i.e. 64 bits $b_0,b_1,...,b_{63}$ that each can take the values 0 or 1. They are used to represent a decimal number $a$ on the form\n",

Note that $e = 00000000000$ and $e=1111111111$ are interpreted as $0$ and $\\infty$ respectively, so e takes values between 1 and 2046. The mantissa $1.b_{1}b_{2}b_{3}....b_{52}$ is a real number in base 2 with values between 1 and 2:\n",
