    "Sometimes, one cannot find the derivative of a function in the usual manner. This can happen if the function is very hard to differentiate, if you don't know exactly how the function is defined (which can be the case with [black box systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box), or if you have little time and don't want to bother differentiating the function.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you can approximate the derivative by using difference approximations. The easiest one of these is to choose a small h and using this, approximate the derivative by the value $$f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approximation is better, the smaller $h$ is. We can see this as following: If we assume that $f$ is twice differentiable, Taylor's theorem states that $$f(x + h) = f(x) + hf'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2}f''(z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is between $x$ and $x+h$. If we rearrange the terms, we find that $$f'(x) = \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} + \\frac{h}{2}f''(z).$$\n",
